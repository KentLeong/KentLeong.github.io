This blog is about my adventures of writing my first sinatra application. My original idea was to have a website where people can come and create tests and study. However, as I started writing the application, I noticed that it would take a long time to add all the features of what I want. So instead of being able to study the tests that people create, I just made it so people can create/read/update/delete tests. Of course they would also be able to take the test and see what score they got. Overall, this was a great experience and I loved it! It really got me to experience how to manipulate my data and spit it out to the user. There is so many more features that I want to add, but I am told that rails is better than sinatra. So I will probably hold off till then =)
