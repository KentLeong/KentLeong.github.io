A responsive layout is where the layout of your web application, responds to different environments. When you're looking at a website on a computer, it should have content according to that screen. However, when you jump to a mobile screen, the screen isnt as large anymore. So to tackle this problem, we use responsive layout, where the content changes according to the device.
