This app was so fun to make! I don't even know where to begin. I didn't fully complete it, but I want to hold off on the extra features until I get to know javascript. I can't wait to add front-end functionality! This lab has taught me so much about databases and how to mainpulate them. I feel like I can get comfortable with any database now.

This idea I had for the rails assessment was really daunting at first. But when you stop looking at the application as a whole and then start to break down each part of the app. It gets a lot easier to deal with and it becomes less scary.
